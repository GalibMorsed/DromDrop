## üß∫ Hostel Laundry Management System - "DromDrop"

**DromDrop** is an innovative hostel laundry management platform built using the MERN stack. It streamlines weekly laundry operations for both students and laundry staff with a focus on fairness, clarity, and efficiency.

### üîç What Makes DromDrop Unique?

In many hostels, laundry management is either done manually or through outdated systems, leading to confusion, delays, and disputes. Swashly changes the game by offering:

- **Clothing Limits and Extra Charges**  
  Students can submit clothes weekly, but only within a fixed limit. Extra items or non-listed categories (like sweaters, curtains, etc.) automatically trigger additional charges ‚Äî fully transparent and logged.

- **Two-Way Communication**  
  Laundry staff can view each student's weekly submission, confirm pickups, and update payment status. Once dues are cleared, extra items are removed from both ends, ensuring a clean, dispute-free record.

- **Smart Submission Tracking**  
  Students select their clothing types from a predefined list and are warned in real-time if they're exceeding limits or adding chargeable items.

- **Weekly Cycle Optimization**  
  Swashly defines pickup and submission days and ensures weekly records are automatically reset ‚Äî keeping the cycle clean and efficient.

This project aims to bring **structure, trust, and automation** into hostel laundry processes ‚Äî something often overlooked but essential to student life.
